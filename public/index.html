    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>RESTume was built by <a href="http://dd0t.com">Todd Bealmear</a> to provide his resume as an API.</p>
    <p>The resource list is below, but you can also check out the source on 
      <a href="https://github.com/toddward/RESTume">GitHub</a>. A few notes on the source:
      <ul>
        <li>Written with Ruby on Sinatra.</li>
        <li>No DataMapper - all resume data is saved in a YAML file. A database would have
          been overkill for this project.</li>
        <li>This is my first real go with Ruby, but Sinatra made developing this super easy.
          I took me very little time to throw together with only a little previous Ruby experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> The API</h2>
    <p>All responses are JSON. There are no PUT or DELETE methods allowed on any of the resources.
      A single resource allows POST - this is to send a message to me if you're interested in getting
      in touch.</p>
